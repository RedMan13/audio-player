# Audio Player
simply a light weight cli-based audio player, like spotify but objectively better in every way but the interface.

## Known bugs
- [ ] Audio chunks play twice on app start
- [ ] Scrolling to fast can cause `ao_play` to get stuck
- [x] ~~Keys wont act after using control sequences like up down left and right~~
