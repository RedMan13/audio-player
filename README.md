# Audio Player
simply a light weight cli-based audio player, like spotify but objectively better in every way but the interface.

- [x] ~~Scrolling to fast can cause `ao_play` to get stuck~~
- [x] ~~Keys wont act after using control sequences like up down left and right~~
- [x] ~~UTF8 encoded text will artifact as the play bar passes by extended characters~~
- [x] ~~Audio will crackle and pop on some samples, mainly noticable with strong base~~
